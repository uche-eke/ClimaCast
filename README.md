### ClimaCast AI: Personalized Weather Insights
**Description**  
ClimaCast AI is a weather application built with React that combines real-time weather data with machine learning to offer personalized weather insights based on user location and preferences. This project was inspired by my interest in AI applications and the potential to make data more meaningful. ClimaCast AI allows users to get weather forecasts tailored to their usual activities, such as commuting or outdoor sports. The model analyzes historical data and user behavior to provide proactive suggestionsâ€”like bringing an umbrella or wearing a jacket if conditions are chilly. This project taught me a lot about API integration and machine learning basics in React.

**Key Features**
- **Real-Time Weather**: Uses a weather API to provide up-to-the-minute weather data.
- **AI Suggestions**: Machine learning component that tailors recommendations based on user activities.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed to work on mobile and desktop devices.

**How to Use**
1. **Log in or Sign up**: Create an account or log in to start using ClimaCast AI.
2. **Set Preferences**: Select preferences such as your usual commute time, outdoor activities, and typical clothing.
3. **Get Weather Updates**: View the real-time forecast for your area with proactive AI suggestions on appropriate attire or preparations.
